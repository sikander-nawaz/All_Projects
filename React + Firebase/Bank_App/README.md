The application includes a range of functionalities, such as:

- Authentication with email and password, as well as login via social media accounts like Google, Facebook, and Github.

- Once authenticated, users are taken to the dashboard, which is the central hub for all banking activities. The dashboard provides users with access to an ATM machine-like interface, where they can perform basic banking transactions such as withdrawing and depositing money.

- Users can easily withdraw or deposit money from their accounts using the intuitive interface, which guides them through the process step-by-step. Additionally, they can also view their transaction history, which displays all past transactions with details such as date, amount, and account balance.

- The Bank-App also allows users to delete their account, in case they no longer wish to use the platform.
- The application provides users with the ability to view all their existing accounts, providing a complete overview of their financial situation.
